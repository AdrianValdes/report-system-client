> Frontend solution to buildau's fullstack challenge

Here are some comments on my solution, they are no excuses, I would only like to explain the process a little bit and the reason of some of my most doubtable choices:

1. The first thing I would improve from my solution if I would have had more time is the error handling, right now I am just showing the error in the UI, which can be very unfriendly.

2. I didn't implement a good notification system in the UI for two main reasons: I didn't thought that was a main part in the challenge, I used the rest of the time to make the UI look better.

3. I decided to handle the blocking having a black list with the blocked Ids, as the task was to implement a full-stack application only for the spam protection team, I assumed the idea was to handle the blocking only in that side without building the social media part.

## Install

```sh
npm install
```
